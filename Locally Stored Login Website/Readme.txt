To run this program:
1. Start by downloading all three files. They are hardcoded to trace my personal C: drive, so the JavaScript elements may need to be altered to fit your machine.
2. Open either the signIn.html or registration.html
3. Use these pages as a normal website.
4. Your system will treat these three pages as a traditional website, even though it is all stored locally!
